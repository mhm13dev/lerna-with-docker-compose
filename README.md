# Nest.js API, Vite React Client with Lerna + Docker Compose

This is a monorepo project that contains a Nest.js API and a Vite React client. The project uses `Lerna` to manage the monorepo and `Docker Compose` to run the services.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have following installed on your machine:

ðŸ‘‰ Node.js (LTS version)

ðŸ‘‰ NPM

ðŸ‘‰ Docker Desktop (including Docker Compose)

## Getting Started

ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ **DO NOT "npm install" from host! Always install packages from inside a running docker container!!!** ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
# Create .env file in packages/api
cd packages/api
cp .env.example .env

# Create .env file in packages/client
cd packages/client
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:

```bash
# Start Development
docker compose --profile development up -d

# Stop Development
docker compose --profile development down

# Start / Stop / Restart All Services
docker compose --profile development <start|stop|restart>

# Start / Stop / Restart Specific Service
docker compose --profile development <start|stop|restart> <service-name>

# Production
docker compose --profile production up -d

# Stop Production
docker compose --profile production down
```

## Installing Packages

ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ **DO NOT "npm install \<package-name\>" from host! Always install packages from inside a running docker container!!!** ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

To install packages, use the following flow:

ðŸ‘‰ Open Docker Desktop

ðŸ‘‰ Open the container in which you want to install packages

ðŸ‘‰ Open the Exec Console

ðŸ‘‰ Run the following command:

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

ðŸ’¥ It is important to install packages from inside the container to ensure that the correct dependencies are installed which can work cross-platform.

Following the above steps will install the packages in the `node_modules` directory of the _container_ which is mounted to the `node_modules` directory of the _host machine (your computer)_ ensuring the IDE intellisense works correctly.

## Accessing the Services

You can check the Ports for every service in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

ðŸ‘‰ API: http://localhost:3000

ðŸ‘‰ Client: http://localhost:3001

## Useful Information

ðŸ‘‰ There are 2 profiles in `docker-compose.yml`: `development` and `production`.

ðŸ‘‰ The `Dockerfile.dev` in the root directory has a `development` stage which is used to create `setup-development` service which esnures installation of packages in the monorepo before starting any other service.

ðŸ‘‰ The `Dockerfile` in the `packages/api` and `packages/client` directories are used for building `production` images for each service.

ðŸ‘‰ Environment Variables in `development`:

- The _environment variables_ are loaded from `.env` files. They are available in containers because we are mounting whole monorepo into the containers during `development`.
- After adding, updating, deleting an environment variable, we need to restart the specific service using `docker compose --profile development restart <service-name>` in order for changes to take effect.

ðŸ‘‰ Environment Variables in `production`:

- The _environment variables_ for `packages/client` service are defined in `packages/client/Dockerfile` because they are needed at the build time.
- The _environment variables_ for `packages/api` service are passed as `env_file` from `docker-compose.yml` because they are needed at the runtime.
